/**\brief Struct containing the ADSR info.
 *
 * ADSR stands for *A*ttack, *D*ecay, *S*ustain, *R*elease.
 * The attack represents how long it takes the Oscillator to get to a volume of 1
 * if a note is sounded.
 * The decay parameter represents how long it takes oscillator to return
 * to the sustain volume after it reached the max of the initial attack.
 * The sustain as indicated above is the volume level after the decay. The
 * Oscillator will continuously hold the note volume until the note is released.
 * The release paramater represents how long it takes the oscillator volume to
 * revert to 0 after a note off event was received.
